# Formula 1 Strategy Simulation

Effective strategy plays a vital role in securing victory in Formula 1 races, and as regulations impose greater constraints on teams, the importance of simulation becomes increasingly apparent. This dissertation focuses on the implementation of a simulation tool for formula 1 race strategy, building upon previous research by introducing techniques for parameterising the model and visualizing the results. The dissertation also explores an innovative approach to overtaking that considers probabilities, departing from the conventional notion that superior pace guarantees successful overtakes. By addressing these key elements, this research contributes to enhancing strategic decision-making in the sport.
