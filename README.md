# Formula 1 Strategy Simulation

Effective strategy plays a vital role in securing victory in Formula 1 races, and as regulations impose greater constraints on teams, the importance of simulation becomes increasingly apparent. This implementation of the strategy simulation tool, builds upon previous research by introducing techniques for parameterising the model and visualizing the results. The implementation also introduces an innovative approach to overtaking that considers probabilities, departing from the conventional notion that superior pace guarantees successful overtakes. By addressing these key elements, this project contributes to enhancing strategic decision-making in the sport.
